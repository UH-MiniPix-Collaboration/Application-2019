\subsubsection{Cosmic Rays}
Understanding the biological effect of radiation on humans is cruicial for successful space flight.
By observing the environment in which astronauts reside, information regarding the conditions which induce the biological changes can be gathered.
Among this information is dosage of various particles.
In the upper atmosphere, primary particles, which consist largely of protons (p\textsuperscript{+}) and ionized atomic nuclei \cite{Frank}, collide with the nuclei of air molecules and can induce air showers.
These air showers produce secondary particles, which consist of positrons/electrons (e\textsuperscript{$\pm$}), neutrons(n), muons($\mu$\textsuperscript{$\pm$}), pions ($\pi$\textsuperscript{$\pm$}), and various other hadrons.
The primary particles of interest are Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs), which originate outside of the solar system but within the Milky Way Galaxy and typically have been accelerated to nearly the speed of light \cite{GCRs}.

The results from the previous missions have confirmed the successful application of the MiniPIX as a dosimeter through the idenification of the Regener-Pfotzer Maximum. This maximum is the altitude at which ionizing radiation reaches its peak \cite{Regener}. The value of this altitude depends on various environmental factors, but it is around \SI{18}{\kilo\meter}. With this confirmation, the MiniPIX will remain the primary tool we will use to measure radiation.

Primary particles can induce an air shower by colliding with the nucleus of any atom or particle.
This poses a potential threat to astronauts residing in spacecrafts, as the materials in the spacecraft's structure can induce an air shower and thus bombard astronauts with radiation.
By using a MiniPIX to measure the radiation outside of as well as within a structure emulating a module from the Internation Space Station, we can observe the environment that current astronauts live in and how the structure changes the radiation field.
Additionaly, the measurements outside of the structure will give information as to the conditions in which atmospheric extremophiles reside.


\subsubsection{Organic Solar Cells}
	Harvesting energy in space is a huge concern, but with a constant supply of photons streaming from the sun, solar power is an obvious, and convenient choice for energy generation. When choosing a system to gather solar energy, one of the largest concerns is getting the system out out to space. The largest economic factor here is weight, which is why organic solar cells (OSC) are an active area of research for space energy generation. Being extremely light weight, the initial cost of transportation is drastically less than traditional solar cells, and with a high degree of flexibility, OSCs offer a larger surface area for application. 
	
	OSCs use earth abundant, carbon based semiconductors, such as conjugated polymers(as donors) and fullerene derivatives(as acceptors). Where as in mono-crystalline solar cells the valance and conduction bands are used to determine the energy band gap, OSCs model the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbit(HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit(LUMO) as equivalent to this energy band gap. When donor(D) and acceptor(A) layers meet, their Fermi levels match up and band bending occurs, which creates a small electric field, or built in potential (Vbi). Charge generation occurs when excitons, an electron/hole pair bound together by the Coulomb force, are generated in the donor material. This exciton will travel towards to D-A interface, where the aforementioned Vbi will seperate the exciton into free charges given sufficient conditions.  Exciton transportation inside of the bulk is hindered to 5-50nm before recombination occurs depending on material and structure, while the average thickness of an OSC is 50-100nm, thus the architecture of the active layer is of much importance. Instead of using a bi-layer of n-type and p-type semiconductors, OSCs use the bulk hetero-junction (BHJ), which is a blend with A-D regions that are within the estimated diffusion length.  
	
	

	Space transport involves high doses of radiation, large fluctuations of temperatures, and extreme vacuum conditions. The need to study the effects of a space like environment on organic electronic devices is paramount as advances in the organic semiconductor field continue and space exploration becomes more standard. The effect of cosmic ray bombardment on perovskite cells is of particular interest as the crystal morphology may be affected. 


%\subsubsection{Solar Radiation}
%The ultraviolet (UV) spectrum is composed of UVC (\SIrange{200}{280}{\nano\meter}) with only \SI{0.5}{\percent} of the entire solar spectrum, 1.5\% of
%UVB (\SIrange{280}{315}{\nano\meter}) and UVA (\SIrange{315}{400}{\nano\meter}), which contributes to \SI{6.3}{\percent}~\cite{uv_irradiance}. UVB and UVC are the main contributors in highly lethal solar radiation to microorganisms\cite{UVonDNA}. DNA is prone to high absorption levels at those wavelengths, often causing inactivation and mutation.  Therefore, understanding the exposure of microbes in to UV radiation is quite important.

%In the atmosphere ionizing radiation does not always increase with altitude. As
%primary GCRs such as high energy protons, alpha particles, and 
%heavy ions collide with atoms in the atmosphere they begin to shatter into secondary
%particles such as neutrons, pions, electrons and muons which causes a peak in 
%ionizing radiation at around \SI{18}{\kilo\meter}. This peak is known 
%as the Regener-Pfotzer Maximum\cite{regener} and shows that with increasing atmospheric density
% ionizing radiation increases until peaking high in the stratosphere and then decreases rapidly as you
