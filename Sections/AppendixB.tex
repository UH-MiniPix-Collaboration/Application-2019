\section{Appendix B: Application Response}
\label{sec:Appendix B}

Appendix B constitutes the UH HASP team's official response to the feedback provided in the HASP 2019 Application review. We have addressed and answered all questions and concerns given on the application response. We have included several visuals that are up-to-date depictions of our current vision for the SORA 3 project.

<<Input the disucssion regarding the connection between the three experiments here>>

\subsection{Payload Design}

We have made slight modifications to our power and weight budget, as well as added the uncertainty in the values. These changes are reflected in Table \ref{tab:PWBudget-Updated}

Figure \ref{fig:PayloadDrawing-Updated} addresses the height violation presented in our original application.
The extension of the astrobiology T-arm has been reduced so that the lid remains within the height limit of \SI{300}{\milli\meter}.
As a result, we will not be requesting a height wavier.

Our payload footprint overlayed on the HASP mounting plate is explicitly shown in the Figure \ref{fig:PayloadFootprint} along with the closest distances between the SORA 3 payload and the boundaries set by HASP.
Also shown in Figure \ref{fig:PayloadFootprint} is the requested direction of orientation of our payload.
We do not have a preference to where our payload is placed on the central structure.

\subsection{Electronics}

The baud rate for all serial communication will be set to 4800 bits per second. To utilize serial commands, the DB9 connection will feed into an RS232 to TTL converter which will then be read by our flight computer.

The electronics diagram presented in Figure \ref{fig:WiringDiagram-Updated}  has been updated to provide a more detailed and accurate depiction of our current system plans.
The updated diagram features the voltage required by each device for operation and the data lines from each device.

As suggesting by a reviewer, will utilize the serial commands shown in Table \ref{tab:SerialCommands}. These commands will serve as backup to the discrete commands presented in the original application.

\subsection{Team Structure}

Additionally, the team structure had a slight modification.
We had a change in position of electronics coordinator, and Figure \ref{fig:TeamRoleTree-Updated} reflects the change in this leadership role.
