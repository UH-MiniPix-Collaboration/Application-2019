\section{Thermal Control Plan}
\label{sec:TCP}


Based on our previous missions~\cite{SORA1}\cite{SORA2}, we have designed a thermal control plan centered around the high-performance devices. The devices that are at highest risk of thermal failure are the RP3 and the two MiniPIX devices. The data from the previous SORA missions strongly suggest that all devices will remain above their lower temperature limit. If a device were to experience thermal failure, it would be by overheating.

The temperature of all high-performance devices will be downlinked and monitored by the mission control team. In the case of a device overheating, said device will be shut down until it is safe to resume operations. The RP3 will be considered overheating if the temperature exceeds \SI{85}{\celsius}. A MiniPIX will be considered overheating if the device temperature exceeds \SI{80}{\celsius}.

In attempt to prevent overheating, each device will be configured with an individual metal heat sink. The RP3's processor will be equipped with a heat sink designed specifically for that device. Using the same technique used on the previous mission, each of the MiniPIX devices will be fixed to a plate of aluminum. For the MiniPIX contained in the pressurized environment, an aluminum heat pipe will be used to distribute heat from the device to the outer aluminum shell.
