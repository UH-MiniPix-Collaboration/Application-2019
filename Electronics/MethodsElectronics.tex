\subsubsection{Overview}

The RESUs primary purpose during the flight will be to monitor environmental and system conditions and control the astrobiology systems. It will monitor temperature of the various subsystems and pressure of the main structure and ISS module throughout the flight. All recorded data will be written in discrete files to an SD card mounted on a shield on top of the Arduino in addition to a removable USB flash drive connected to the Raspberry Pi. It will also accept discrete commands from the HASP systems to turn the astrobiology collection system on and off and return the operation status of the astrobiology system.

\subsubsection{The Sensors}

Our payload will utilize 16 thermistors to measure temperature at various points in our payload. The decision to use thermistors was based primarily on the performance of the analog temperature sensors during our 2017 flight, during which several of those sensors failed. Furthermore, thermistors performed well in our 2018 flight. Thermistors are able to accurately measure temperature in the range \SIrange{-55}{125}{\celsius} and should therefore be adequate for the conditions in the stratosphere. Pressure will be recorded from two digital pressure sensors, one low pressure sensor in the main payload structure which will record pressure in the range \SIrange{0}{24.82}{\kilo\pascal} and the second pressure sensor which records in the range \SIrange{20}{110}{\kilo\pascal} will be located inside the ISS module. All sensor data will be UTC timestamped via the onboard Real Time Clock and recorded to the Arduino SD card and Raspberry Pi USB drive.


 \subsubsection{Powering It All Up}

 In order to stay within the power constraints, a robust power supply will need to  handle all the components of the payload.  The power supply we will be using is the PCM-DC-AT500 by WinSystems INC.  It offers one \SI{+5}{\volt} needed to power the payload's electronics.  This power supply could effectively take \SI{+30}{\volt} and step it up to two \SI{+12}{\volt} and two \SI{+5 }{\volt} outputs.  One of the \SI{+12}{\volt} outputs goes to the Arduino since it can step down to the appropriate voltages internally while the other goes to a PWM motor for the solenoid.  One of the \SI{+5 }{\volt} outputs powers two analog sensors that will be sent to HASP through the EDAC connection (more on that in the next sections).  The remaining \SI{+5 }{\volt} output is converted to a USB power cable for the RP3.  The power supply also has four ground outputs that will be used by each respective component.

Each packet of data will be delimited by keywords \verb|begin_packet| and \verb|end_packet| so that parsing each file be easier.  During our previous flight, these data packets were crucial status updates to the state of our payload.  We will once again use them for the same purpose to keep a close eye on our payload.

Data packets will contain information about the readings from each sensor.  The first integer represents the ID of the packet.  Following the packet ID are the three temperature readings, gyroscope $x, y, z$ values, accelerometer $x, y, z$ values, magnetometer $x, y, z$ values, pressure readings, humidity readings, UV \#1, \#2, \#3 voltage readings, and finally the timestamp in $HH$:$MM$:$SS$ $MM$/$DD$/$YY$ at which the packet was written.  

This year the data packets will contain a 

In addition to downlinking sensor data, we also want to downlink serial uplink commands as shown in listing \ref{Uplinks}.

Each line within a received uplink command represents the string of bytes that will be read by our payload.  The last line of the listing shows what command will be parsed and processed by RESU.  Table \ref{tab:All-Commands} shows all the possible commands that we are expecting to process.
